=> The increasing volume of cyber threats necessitates advanced techniques for detecting and filtering malicious domains in real time. 

=> This project presents a DNS Filtering System that leverages AI-driven semantic similarity analysis and Threat Intelligence Feeds to identify and 
block potentially harmful domains. 

=> The system employs Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a state-of-the-art NLP model, to compute the semantic similarity between DNS queries and predefined 
cybersecurity threat keywords. 

=> Using cosine similarity scoring, the model determines the likelihood of a domain being associated with malicious activities such as phishing, 
malware distribution, ransomware, and botnets. 

=> Queries exceeding a predefined similarity threshold are flagged as potential threats. 

=> The system is designed for integration into real-time DNS security frameworks, enhancing proactive defense mechanisms against cyber threats. 

=> This approach significantly improves the accuracy of DNS filtering by incorporating AI-driven language understanding, reducing false positives 
compared to traditional rule-based methods.
